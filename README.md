# Versioned Quartz GitHub Pages Deployment Action
GitHub Action for the deployment of versioned [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) sites to GitHub Pages.
This allows for the parallel hosting of sites for multiple versions of the same repository.
The hosted static sites are stored on a separate branch.

For the unversioned setup see [Quartz GitHub Pages Deployment Action](https://github.com/RelativeProgramming/quartz-gh-pages-deploy)
